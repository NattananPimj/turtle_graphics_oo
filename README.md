# OO code using turtle graphics
- To run my program you can just simply type 
```Run().run_choice()```
 or create object from class Run to run the code
- Then the program will asl for art type from 1 to 9 and your art will generate

# Some Problems
- when i run for the first time the program couldn't run since the program wont get string input, so i decide to delete all my code and do it again
    - then I found out that I forgot to bring the setup code to run so i tried out and now its work
- I did some coding again and then see some of the code are duplicate so i made them a function
    - while I was doing function for randomize the number of shapes in each, the function(Method) does not take the tuple and use it directly so i have to modify a bit
- somtimes the drawing window did not instantly popped in to my screen but it stayed in the task bar
